\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Divergence when EE is close to goal.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Idea\+: Small tau + close to goal = small value = underflow?
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Last box appears to sometimes not have collision.
\item Contact points switch between links and obstacles... how to make consistant?

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Contact\+Point is heap allocated, create better structure to avoid this.
\item B Matrix.
\item Dynamic polymorphism for shapes rather than function overloading.
\item Review structure and program flow.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pay special attention to getters and whether they return references.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Link safety distance so it only is changed in one place.
\item Sparse matrix multiplication for jacobians.
\item Review power of Dual\+Quat.
\item Motion Planner loop takes $\sim$50-\/250 us.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Set\+Joint\+Angles() takes $\sim$40 us.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 3 us for kinematics, 37 us for generate\+Contacts().
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Majority of time spent in physx specific functions, not much room for optimization here.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Maybe I could use aggregates to better optimize broad phase as there is little difference between no contacts and contacts in time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Sc\+LERP takes $\sim$10 us.
\item Collision\+Displacement takes $\sim$0-\/200 us ().
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item LCP generation takes $\sim$90\% of this time.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Majority of time in generation split evenly between pseudo\+Inv and assignment to M.
\item Suggest I rework to accomplish three things\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Store column specific information as it is computed multiple times.
\item Traverse the matrix for assignment in column-\/major order.
\item Write my own pseudo-\/inverse function, or use QR/\+SVD decomposition, or some other least-\/squares solution.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add gripper bodies and joints.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Do I need to switch to a Kinematic\+Tree?
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Add metric to determine if the grasp is possible.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Distance + Normals.
\item Take the normals from the object to both of the grippers, and if they lie within a certain cone, it is a good grasp.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_docs_issues_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{LCP Solver}\label{md_docs_issues_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Look into IGS solver.
\item Switch to OOP.
\item Add proper tests.
\item Can choose pivots with collision information. Closest points tell us next best pivot?
