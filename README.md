# LCPMotionPlanner
## Summary
LCPMotionPlanner is a task space motion planner with global and local obstacle avoidance for spatial manipulators.

The planning framework consists of a global and local planner. The global planner is an RRT planner that will sample poses in the task space. The local planner, also a task space planner, is screw linear interpolation (ScLERP) based, and has obstacle avoidance formulated as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). 

Movement of the manipulator to avoid obstacles is projected onto the null space of the jacobian, which ensures end-effector constraints will always be satisfied, even while actively avoiding obstacles.

The benefits of this approach over a traditional joint space RRT planner are computational efficiency, natural motion generation, and intuitive expression of the motion planning problem for everyday manipulation tasks.

## Supported Platforms
Currently, only Windows and Linux are supported. For Windows, builds have been tested on Windows 11 with MSVC 17. For Linux, builds have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with GCC 9.4.0.

## Documentation
To generate documentation, run doxygen using the supplied Doxyfile, and open index.html.
```bash
cd docs/doxygen
doxygen Doxyfile
cd html && firefox index.html
```

## Dependencies
LCPMotionPlanner has three dependencies - Eigen, PhysX, and Boost. Eigen and PhysX are included as submodules of this repository and handled by CMake, so no extra effort is required to get started. A local installation of Boost will be needed. Please download the header files, and modifiy the location of the folder in the root CMakeLists.txt.

If you are on Linux, you may need some extra packages for PhysX. Run the below command to ensure you do not get any issues related to missing header files.

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libxxf86vm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib freeglut3-dev lib32z1
```

## Build Configurations
PhysX ships with four build configurations. Prefer to use the debug or release mode as they are most stable with LCPMotionPlanner.
- "debug": Full debug build of PhysX + LCPMotionPlanner with checks and visualization.
- "checked": Release build of PhysX with checks and visualization + release build of LCPMotionPlanner with debugging.
- "profile": Release build of PhysX without chceks but still with visualization + release build of LCPMotionPlanner with debugging.
- "release": Full release build of PhysX + LCPMotionPlanner with no visualization or debugging.

## Build Instructions
Clone the repository and setup submodules.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tom-Forsyth/LCPMotionPlanner.git
cd LCPMotionPlanner
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

Run CMake with the desired build configuration to generate a makefile (Linux) or Visual Studio solution (Windows).
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
```

If you are on Linux, build the project using the make file, and run the simulation.
```bash
cd build
make -j20
./LCPMotionPlanner
```

If you are on Windows, open "LCPMotionPlanner.sln" inside of the build directory. Press F7 to build the solution, and run the simulation.

## Debug Visualization
Currently, debug visualization is only supported through PhysX Visual Debugger, which is only available for Windows. With PhysX Visual Debugger open, run the simulation, and the primatives of the scene will appear in the PVD player. Release builds do not support debug visualization - please use debug, checked, or profile builds.

## High Fidelity Visualization
Realistic visualation is available through UnrealSim, where we are using this module to generate collision free plans for the Franka Panda manipulator. Objects can be placed into the UnrealSim simulation scene, and the objects will then be loaded in as primatives into this library to generate and visualze a collision free plan.

## Example Simulation
An [example simulation](src/main.cpp) for the Franka Panda is provided.
